For this weeks game, I'm presenting a top down shooter game that focuses on shooting baddies and dodging bullets.

A DEMO:

This weeks theme is framework. I decided to go with improving how my game worked through adding missing 
feature, and adding more to the game. I followed the theme by improving the framework of the game
by improving the games structure and code through adding features and bug fixing.

More importantly, I would like to show the CREDITS.

The main game's mechanics are from a really good tutorial series by jmbiv, i'll link his channel and the playlist

A huge amount of respect for this guy, he hard carrys my projects(for mutiple weeks.)

The Coder Kid also played a pretty huge role, his video on a Godot top down shooter is pretty good
and a large part of the inspiration for this project

ThinkWithGames has an excellent video on using NavigationAreas and Agents to make enemy tracking
which was so helpful..

For week 2 I've watched one more tutorial;

RobottoBani has a really simple but useful tutorial to make really good looking main menus and screen transitions, 
which is something I hadn't really tried before, which made this tutorial amazing.

AI

This time I sadly have AI in the project. 
It only is used in the starry night sky backgrounds (with the stars and comets in the bg)

As far as I can tell the texture used for the planet terrain doesn't use AI, it uses algorithims to make planets 
and comes from a website older than AI becoming popular (2007)
