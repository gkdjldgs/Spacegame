For this weeks game, I'm presenting a top down shooter game that focuses on shooting baddies and dodging bullets.

This weeks theme is space, so I choose to make a game thats focused in 
space on a distant planet fighting aliens in space.

More importantly, I would like to show the CREDITS.

The main game's mechanics are from a really good tutorial series by jmbiv, i'll link his channel and the playlist

A huge amount of respect for this guy, he hard carried my project.

The Coder Kid also played a pretty huge role, his video on a Godot top down shooter is pretty good
